        <h1>The Role of Heralds</h1>
        <h3>Special Feature: A Heralds's Job</h3>
        <p>      Heralds were originally keepers of records in military events such as tournaments, and, on occasion, battles. With the dawn of the heraldic art form, heralds began to have lists of the shields of all participants in these events, called
            “rolls of arms”. There was a time when each powerful nobleman had his own herald, and they acted as ambassadors. Although heralds predated classical heraldry, these days they are tied more closely to the art of heraldry. In most parts of the
            world, heralds must still approve a coat of arms before it is put into use. In fact, residents of the United States must be approved by a different heraldic organization depending on their ancestry!</p>

        <h3>Heralds Hard at Work Preparing for Tournament (on location, 1453)</h3>
        <p>      Today is the day of the start of Lord Rhine’s great tournament. Knights are filing through the streets, some going to prepare for the opening ceremonies, and some, last minute arrivals, are heading to the heralds to sign up. The heralds
            are currently hard at work checking qualifications of each of the knights, making a note of all of the arms that will be born by the knights, and recording the choices of events. As the opening ceremonies begin, heralds announce the names
            of each of the knights enrolled. It honestly seems that the heralds are working harder than the knights, scurrying around trying to keep track of every minute detail. I shall report on the results of the tournament in three days when it finishes,
            but until then, this is all I have to say.
